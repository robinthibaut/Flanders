# Re-Projecting | Re-projecting is the process of changing the representation of locations from one coordinate system
# to another. All projections of locations on the Earth into a two-dimensional plane are distortions, the projection
# that is best for your application may be different from the projection associated with the data you import. In
# these cases, data can be re-projected using the GeoDataFrame.to_crs() command:

flanders_wgs = flanders.to_crs("EPSG:4326")
